            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am an Honors Computing Science student at the University of Alberta with a secondary
                focus in mathematics and statistics. I am passionate about creating innovative technology that makes
                life simpler and solves everyday problems. I am always excited to learn something new and have
                experience working in a variety of team settings.

            <h3>Experience</h3>
            <p>I have completed several internships throughout my studies which have helped me develop my skills as
                a software engineer. This past summer, I worked as a Software Engineering intern at Microsoft, and two
                years ago I worked as a Summer Student Systems Analyst at CGI. I also have experience as a Teaching
                Assistant for the department of Computing Science at the University of Alberta.

            <h3>What can I do for you?</h3>
            <p>I am currently seeking future intern and new grad opportunities, and I believe I would be a valuable
                addition to your team. I am one of the top students in my program at the Univeristy of Alberta, and have
                software engineering experience from several past internships. I have a reputation for being a strong
                leader and team player in team projects and past work experiences. I am goal-oriented and always looking
                for opportunities to learn and challenge myself.
